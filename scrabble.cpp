 * @brief This program reads in text one character at at time and counts the number of
 * occurances of the following letters: 'a', 'g', 'm', 'f', 'k', and 'j' in the text,
 * and determines a total score for the text using a point based scheme. Both lower
 * case and upper case letters are counted together. When a period, '.', or exclamation
 * mark, '!', appears in the input text, the program prints how many of each letter
 * above only, the total score of the text, anf halts. Each letter being counted is
 * assigned a score as follows: 'a' (1 point), 'g' (2 points), 'm' (3 points), 'f'
 * (4 points), 'k' (5 points), and 'j' (8 points). All other characters have a score of
 * 0 points. The total score of the input text is calculated by summing the number of
 * occurences of a letter above multiplied by its score.
